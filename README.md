# PlainJS Key Combination Detector
My take on Exercise 12 of Wes Bos' JavaScript30 [series](https://javascript30.com/), whose goal is to build deeper understanding of JavaScript by refraining from use of opinionated programming paradigms or frameworks in place of a simple focus on core concepts using plain JS.

## About
This shows the user a 'reward' when one of the following classic key combinations have been executed:

- W + S + W + S + A + D + A + D
- W + S + W + S + A + D + D
- W + S + W + S + A + A + D

To make the implementation more challenging and interesting, I decided to add combo timeout, similar to what a user might experience when playing an arcade game where keys must be sequenced within a set delay.
